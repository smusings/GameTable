GameTable is a table top gaming application designed by Smusings using Android Studio. GameTable gives its users to three tools commonly used in tabletop gaming: A Die Roller, a Coin Flipper, and a LifeCounter for Magic the Gathering.
 
The DieRoller uses randomly generated numbers between a certain interval to give the result of one of six (6) options: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 20. 

The LifeCounter portion is a simple application that uses buttons with assigned commands to manipulate a TextView's contents.

The CoinFlipper, like the DieRoller uses a randomly generated numbers (1 or 2) to determine if the the result is Heads or Tails.

This application uses Fragments very heavily in order to create interesting layouts, and try not to repeat code. 

GameTable is a work in progress, and is constantly being looked to be improved upon.
